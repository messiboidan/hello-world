# hello-world

Hello, my name is Dan Loes. 
I am a recent graduate from Iowa State University with a Bachelor's in Management Information Systems.
Currently, I am working as a substitute teacher, a Geek Squad agent, as well as putting time in for a startup called U.bra.
I have been practicing react in my spare time to try and dive into full-stack development.
So far I have become quite familiar with OOP through coursework at ISU. My most fluent languages are Java, Python, and SQL.
